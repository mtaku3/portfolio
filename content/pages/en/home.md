    introduction: >-
      I am currently a student at the National Institute of Technology,
      Kagoshima College, studying Information Engineering and this is my final
      year (5th).

      For my graduation thesis, I am conducting research related to neural
      networks.

      I am interested in programming, deep learning, web app development, and
      reverse engineering. 


      My plan is to attend a university in Japan and continue studying neural
      networks, while also learning about app development in a business setting.

      I am passionate about using modern frameworks and state-of-the-art
      technologies, and as such, I am actively seeking a part-time job or a
      student internship where I can further develop my skills.
