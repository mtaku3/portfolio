    introduction: >-
      This spring, I transferred from a KOSEN to Tokyo Institute of Technology,
      Department of Computer Science for my third year.

      At the KOSEN, I researched on the optimization of coefficients for model
      patching in deep learning.

      At the university, I would like to do research related to large language
      models (LLM).

      My hobbies are listening to music, programming, and studying pure
      mathematics.

      My goals for the time being are

      - To deepen my understanding of AI, not only LLMs, but also from a
      mathematical background.

      - To polish up my programming skills by learning many languages,
      frameworks, and implementation patterns, and eventually make a living as a
      freelance.

      I am currently an intern at TRUSTART Co.

      Currently, I am writing code as an intern at TRUSTART and also doing some
      side projects.

      My coding as a hobby is currently

      - Migration from Arch Linux to NixOS

      - Working on a side project, AMUP (doing PoC of asynchronous plugin system
      with Rust).

      Please teach me ;;
